# DEX API

## Note About Current Limitations

This API documentation currently only features RPC methods that are available in MarketMaker 2.0 (MM2). There are many commands from the legacy Market Maker 1.0 that Komodo intends to import to MM2 as soon as possible. For now, these commands are available at [this external website.](api.kmd.host)

## electrum

**electrum coin urls (mm2)**

::: warning Important

This command must be executed at the initiation of each MM2 instance. Also, Komodo DEX software requires the `mm2` parameter to be set for each `coin`; the methods to activate the parameter vary. See below for further information.

:::

::: tip

Electrum mode is available for utxo-based coins only; this includes Bitcoin and Bitcoin-based forks. Electrum mode is not available for ETH/ERC20.

:::

The `electrum` method enables a `coin` by connecting the user's software instance to the `coin` blockchain using electrum technology (e.g. lite mode). This allows the user to avoid syncing the entire blockchain to their local machine.

Each `coin` can be enabled only once, and in either Electrum or Native mode. The DEX software does not allow a `coin` to be active in both modes at once.  

#### Notes on the mm2 Parameter

For each `coin`, Komodo software requires the user/developer to set the `mm2` parameter. This can be achieved either in the [coins](../atomic-swap-dex/dex-walkthrough.md#setting-up-coin-list) for more deatails), or via the [electrum](../atomic-swap-dex/dex-api.html#electrum) and [enable](../atomic-swap-dex/dex-api.html#enable) methods.

The value of the `mm2` parameter informs the software as to whether the `coin` is expected to function.

- `0` = `non-functioning`
- `1` = `functioning`

When enabling new coins, refer to the configurations in the repository linked below. If the `mm2` parameter is not set in the repository, the coin has not yet been tested with Komodo DEX software. 

[Repository of Komodo DEX software coin configurations](https://github.com/jl777/coins)

Volunteers are welcome to test coins with Komodo DEX software at any time. After testing a coin, please create a pull request with the desired coin configuration and successful swap details using the guide linked below.

[Guide to Submitting Coin Test Results](https://github.com/jl777/coins#0-the-coin-must-be-tested-with-barterdex-atomic-swaps)


##### Examples of the Parameter Settings

Set the value of the `mm2` parameter in the [coins](../atomic-swap-dex/dex-walkthrough.md#setting-up-coin-list) file as follows:

```bash
mm2=1
```

For terminal interface examples, see the examples section below.

### Arguments:

| Structure | Type     | Description |
| --------- | -------- | ----------- |
| coin      | string | the name of the coin you want to enable |
| urls      | array of strings | the urls of Electrum servers to which you want to connect |
| mm2       | number (required if not set in the `coins` file) | this property informs the Komodo DEX software as to whether the coin is expected to function; accepted values are either `0` or `1` |

::: warning Note
If the connection to at least one of the provided `urls` fails for any reason the software will not enable the coin. Instead, the software will return an error.
:::

}
```

## enable

**enable coin (urls swap_contract_address mm2)**

::: warning Important

Komodo DEX software requires the `mm2` parameter to be set for each `coin`; the methods to activate the parameter vary. See below for further information.

:::

The `enable` method enables a coin by connecting the user's software instance to the `coin` blockchain using the `native` coin daemon.

Each `coin` can be enabled only once, and in either Electrum or Native mode. The DEX software does not allow a `coin` to be active in both modes at once.  

For utxo-based coins the daemon of this blockchain must also be running on the user's machine for `enable` to function.  

ETH/ERC20 coins are also enabled by the `enable` method, but a local installation of an ETH node is not required.  

#### Notes on the mm2 Parameter

Please refer to the `mm2` explanatory section in the `electrum` method for information about setting the `mm2` parameter and testing new coins.

[Link to `mm2` explanatory section](../atomic-swap-dex/dex-api.html#notes-on-the-mm2-parameter)

For terminal interface examples using the `mm2` parameter with the `enable` method, see the examples section below.

#### Using Komodo DEX Software on an ETH-Based Network

The following information can assist the user/developer in connecting Komodo DEX software to the Ethereum network:

- Swap smart contract on the ETH mainnet: [0x8500AFc0bc5214728082163326C2FF0C73f4a871](https://etherscan.io/address/0x8500AFc0bc5214728082163326C2FF0C73f4a871) 
  - Main-net node maintained by the Komodo team: <b>http://195.201.0.6:8555</b>  
- Swap smart contract on the Ropsten testnet: [0x7Bc1bBDD6A0a722fC9bffC49c921B685ECB84b94](https://ropsten.etherscan.io/address/0x7bc1bbdd6a0a722fc9bffc49c921b685ecb84b94)

## setprice

**setprice base rel price broadcast=number**

::: warning Note
This API method's documentation is currently limited, as we are still testing.
:::

The `setprice` method places an order on the orderbook, and it relies on this node acting as a `maker` -- also called a `Bob` node.

::: warning Note
`setprice` currently requires that the node can bind ports on a public IP to accept direct TCP connections from other nodes for ordermatching. This requirement will be removed soon.
:::
