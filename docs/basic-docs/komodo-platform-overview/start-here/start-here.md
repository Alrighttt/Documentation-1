### Security

#### Enjoy the Protection of the Bitcoin Hash Rate

Secure your project with the power of the Bitcoin network via Komodo’s delayed proof of work security mechanism. Don’t waste time worrying about attackers.

</div>

<div style="clear: both;">

- Approximately every half hour, a hash of the developers blockchain is notarized to Bitcoin
- All transactions included in the hash are considered to have achieved finality
- For the consensus mechanism, arbitarily choose between a mixture of Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake

### Advantages of the Fluidity Framework

#### Programmable Daemon

Arbitrary code is added directly into the blockchain daemon. This stands apart from the traditional smart-contract platforms, which abstract a smart contract on top of a virtual machine.

#### Modular Design

Smart Chains are composed of independent and autonomous modules that are decoupled from the underlying blockchain consensus mechanism.

#### Autonomous & Sovereign

Smart Chains are not child chains, nor are they dependent on other blockchains.

#### Turing-Complete

The Fluidity framework supports C/C++, and in the future it will also support other languages. Therefore, Fluidity allows for Turing-complete code. With Fluidity, any program or software can be coded to run within your blockchain daemon.

#### No Gas Fees

There are no gas fees with Fluidity. Regardless of how many processes a Fluidity module requires, running an instance of the module will only need a single transaction fee, paid in your blockchain’s coin.

#### Fluidity Module Library

The Fluidity framework already hosts a library of plug-and-play modules. Each module can add special conditions that affect the nature of transaction consensus on your Smart Chain.

#### Create Your Own Modules

Experienced developers can write custom modules, creating the building blocks and RPC calls they need to build more advanced blockchain-based software.

## Introduction to AtomicDEX

Komodo provides open-source atomic-swap software for trading seamlessly between essentially any blockchain asset in existence.

</div>

#### Enjoy All the Benefits of the Old System, and of the New

Everything that was possible in the old centralized-exchange system is also possible in the new atomic-swap system.

High-speed trading is easy, the DEX API allows you to create atomic-swap powered apps and trading bots, and you can even trade on your mobile phone. 

Our DEX software is not bound to Komodo-based blockchain assets, either. If a blockchain asset can trade on a centralized exchange, odds are you can atomically swap this asset on our DEX software.

#### Skip the Centralized Middleman and Trade Directly with Your Trading Partner

In an atomic swap, there is no need to lend your money to a third party for temporary holding. This keeps security in the hands of the user, reduces the cost of fees, and prevents the users from coalescing their funds into a large target for hackers.

#### Keep Your Private Keys Private, At All Times

Unlike a centralized exchange, users maintain ownership over their blockchain assets at all times, right up until the moment when their assets are atomically swapped.

#### Join the Crowd, or Start a New One

Users create their own liquidity pools for trading between assets. You can use a pool that is already established, or start your own pool.

#### No Off-Chain Settlements Required

The Komodo software uses atomic-swap technology, pioneered by Tier Nolan and our very own JL777, to ensure that a trade either happens, or it doesn't. If a trade stalls or fails halfway through the process, blockchain software ensures that these funds automatically reappear in the users' wallets.

#### Integrate Your Smart-Chain Asset with Our Software

Integration requires only a few simple steps, and once up and running, you are free to trade your new blockchain-based asset with whomever you decide. 

You are free to discover your own audience.

# Before We Begin

The following section answers common questions a newcomer may have, and prepares the new reader for the installation procedure.

## Assumptions for this Documentation

The Komodo Platform is cutting-edge blockchain technology. To limit the scope of what we cover on the technical-documentation website, we list the following prerequisite knowledge. 

#### Familiarity with the Concept of Blockchain Technology

The reader should be general familiar with the basic concept of blockchain technology and why it matters. If you're not yet familiar, we recommend that you first read Part I of the Komodo Whitepaper.

[<b>Link to Komodo Whitepaper - Read Part 1 (~30 pages)</b>](https://www.komodoplatform.com/whitepaper)

#### Simple Programming Skills

Much of the content on this site will be more understandable for the reader who has a rudimentary understanding of a mainstream programming language. 

Beginner-level knowledge should be sufficient for the majority of the site. For example, the reader should be able to:

- Execute commands on the command line
- Utilize an Application Programming Interface (API)
- Write and execute a rudimentary script in any mainstream language

If you do not have these prerequisite experiences, we encourage you to reach out to our community on [<b>Discord</b>](https://komodoplatform.com/discord). There are thousands of free tutorials online that can help you quickly cover these topics. We will be happy to help you in your search.

### Komodo Language Compatability 

Komodo is a highly capable blockchain technology, and it is designed for compatability with essentially all mainstream programming languages. However, not all developers will need to use its most advanced aspects.

#### A Normal Developer in the Komodo Ecosystem

A typical developer in the Komodo ecosystem will build all their application logic in a separate application that runs outside of their Smart Chain daemon. 

The developer's app will send API requests to their Smart Chain's daemon to update the blockchain state and to take advantage of Komodo's default Fluidity modules. (Fluidity modules provide functionality similar to the "smart contracts" that are common on other platforms. However, we argue that Fluidity modules are dramatically more powerful.) 

For this developer, any programming language that is capable of sending API requests to the software daemon is compatible.

#### An Advanced Fluidity Developer

A highly advanced developer may be interested to take advantage of the full potential of Komodo technology. 

This developer can utilize Komodo's Fluidity Framework to add arbitrary code to the consensus mechansim of their autonomous Smart Chain.

Although the Fluidity Framework can be compatible with essentially all mainstream programming languages, at this time we encourage all developers to stay close to the C/C++ languages. 

### Differences between KMD and a Smart Chain

The main KMD blockchain runs on the same underlying framework as all Smart Chains in the ecosystem, but not all features are active on the KMD blockchain.

The KMD chain's active features include Bitcoin-hash rate supported security and the ability to execute Fluidity modules. Other features, such as zero-knowledge privacy, are disabled.

This limitation is intentional. The KMD chain holds all the meta data of the ecosystem. By keeping the functionality limited, Komodo discourages rapid data growth on this central blockchain.

All other Smart Chains in the ecosystem are fully customizable.

## Educational Outline for New Developers

The Komodo Platform offers a wide variety of functionality. Komodo can seem overwhelming at first. We hope this outline can help the reader to structure their approach. 

#### Install the Basic Komodo Software

The first step is to install Komodo software on your machine.

[Follow through the instructions here,](../installations/basic-instructions.html#installing-basic-komodo-software) and return to this spot in the outline when you are finished.

#### Get Acquainted With komodod and komodo-cli

Now that you have `komodod` and `komodo-cli` installed, [skim briefly through the instructions on how to interact with a Komodo-based daemon, linked here](../installations/basic-instructions.html#interacting-with-komodo-chains).

You'll come back to this section later, once you're ready to execute API commands and runtime parameters.

::: tip
You do not need to launch or sync the main Komodo chain (KMD), and you do not need to own any KMD to test a Smart Chain.
:::

#### Create Your First Asset Chain

With `komodod` and `komodo-cli` installed you're ready to spin up a Smart Chain.

[Follow the instructions in this linked guide to build your first Smart Chain.](../installations/creating-asset-chains.html#creating-a-new-asset-chain)

We recommend that you use the simplest of settings for now.

For example:

`./komodod -ac_name=HELLOWORLD -ac_supply=777777 &`

#### Execute Elementary RPC's

After you have your Smart Chain running on both nodes, we recommend executing some basic rpc calls in the terminal.

Here are links to some simple and common rpc examples:

[getnewaddress](../komodo-api/wallet.html#getnewaddress)

[sendtoaddress](../komodo-api/wallet.html#sendtoaddress)

[getinfo](../komodo-api/control.html#getinfo)

As Komodo is downstream from both [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org) and [Zcash](https://z.cash), essentially all of the commands that are available on those two upstream blockchains are also available here.

#### Test Out Platform-Specific Features

We create many features, functionalities, and commands that are specifically designed for dApp and platform-oriented developers.

For example, you can learn how to make Smart Chains that are more complicated in nature.

[Read this documentation first to get the basic idea](../installations/asset-chain-parameters.html).

Once you understand the concept, you can test a few asset-chain tricks -- like making your Smart Chain's consensus mechanism [a mix between Proof of Work and Proof of Stake](../installations/asset-chain-parameters.html#ac-staked).

Or, you could make your Smart Chain suitable for a rapid mining period, followed by complete blockchain disposal. Use parameters such as [ac_end](../installations/asset-chain-parameters.html#ac-end), [ac_reward](../installations/asset-chain-parameters.html#ac-reward), [ac_decay](../installations/asset-chain-parameters.html#ac-decay), and [ac_perc](../installations/asset-chain-parameters.html#ac-perc) for this effect.

#### Discover Custom Consensus Modules

Now you should be ready to head into the territory for utilizing Komodo's built-in methods to customize your own consensus mechanism.

Playing with your consensus mechanism is akin to creating what other blockchain platforms call a "smart contract." However, on Komodo, things are different. We would argue this method is better, but we admit we're biased.

If you need to catch the general idea, read the section, [Custom Consensus Overview](custom-consensus-overview.html).

First, you must create a Smart Chain that has the [ac_cc runtime parameter properly enabled](../installations/asset-chain-parameters.html#ac-cc).

With this activated, you can try a few existing templates:

- [Create ERC20 tokens on your new Smart Chain](../customconsensus/tokens.html)
- Try using your [built-in on-chain DEX](../customconsensus/gateways.html)
- Use [the oracles smart-contract template](../customconsensus/oracles.html) to import real-world data to your blockchain, which can then affect blockchain behavior

...and more!

#### Learn About BarterDEX and Agama

Your Smart Chain can easily be integrated into our native atomic-swap powered DEX, [BarterDEX](../installations/basic-instructions.html#komodo-s-native-dex-barterdex), and our multi-coin wallet, [Agama](https://komodoplatform.com/komodo-wallets/).

You can learn more about both on [docs.komodoplatform.com](https://docs.komodoplatform.com).
