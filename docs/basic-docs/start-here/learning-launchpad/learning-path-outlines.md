# Learning Path Outlines

## Introduction

Welcome to the educational center for Komodo technology.

This section provides a descriptive outline for newcomers in the Komodo ecosystem.

## A Description of Our Intended Audience

As mentioned in the [Documentation Orientation](../../../basic-docs/start-here/about-komodo-platform/orientation.html) section, this website is intended for readers who are already familiar with a mainstream programming language.

Now, we divide readers further into two categories.

##### The Normal Komodo Developer

The first is a developer who intends to utilize Komodo technology only as it is provided to them. This developer likely intends to utilize Komodo software  to release a blockchain product that either stands alone, or compliments another software product the developer is creating.

For example, this developer could be involved with the creation of a blockchain-based asset for a business they are building. This developer expects an audience to purchase and trade these assets, and the audience may utilize Komodo's white-label software for asset management.

As another example, this type of developer could be building a web application that integrates with blockchain technology. The developer could be utilizing Antara Modules, such as [<b>Oracles,</b>](../../../basic-docs/antara/antara-api/oracles.html#introduction) to securely record data that is relevant to or even created by their audience. Once the data is recorded, the developer could display this information on their website, for simple gameplay enhancements or data-driven storytelling.

##### The Advanced Komodo Developer

The advanced Komodo developer intends both to use the Komodo software as it is provided to them, and also to add in their own customized functionality beyond the scope of the default software. This developer is highly skilled in a mainstream programming language, such as C/C++, and is prepared to thoroughly understand and manipulate blockchain software.

For example, this developer may intend to build customized Antara Modules to add to the consensus mechanism of their Smart Chain. These customized modules could create unique and fully playable blockchain-based games, of a complexity level similar to [<b>this Komodo-based Roguelike game</b>](../../../basic-docs/antara/antara-tutorials/rogue-module-tutorial.html#introduction), or [<b>this Komodo-based version of Sudoku.</b>](../../../basic-docs/antara/antara-api/sudoku.html) 

#### How Each Type of Developer Should Approach the Educational Outlines

Both types of developers should begin at the beginning.

The Normal Developer should proceed until they reach the content labeled "Advanced" and then stop, while the Advanced Developer there should proceed.

## Step 1: Install Komodo Software

-------

Priority: Recommended

Difficulty: Normal

Time: 10 Minutes

-------

Access to Komodo software allows the developer to immediately begin learning through direct experimentation.

We recommend that all developers install Komodo software not by using pre-built binaries, but rather by installing and compiling for source code. 

This allows the developer to later have instant access to Komodo security patches, feature enhancements, and upgrades.

## Step 2: Reach Out to Our Community on Discord

-------

Priority: Recommended

Difficulty: Normal

Time: 5 Minutes

-------

Discovering Komodo is best accomplished with a friend. 

Komodo utilizes a third-party chat service called Discord.

[Reach out to us at this link.](https://komodoplatform.com/discord)

Once you are logged in to the Komodo Discord server, you will see a list of channels on the left side of your browser. All channels begin with a `#` hashtag.

Say hello in channels such as `#arrivals`, `#start-here`, and `#introductions`.

The `#community-support` channel is a good place to ask for basic support with Komodo software.

Finally, to find fellow developers, head to the `#dev-general` channel. All channels that begin with `dev` are naturally for developers.

We look forward to meeting you there!

## Step 3: Begin a Conceptual Understanding of Komodo's Software

-------

Priority: Recommended

Difficulty: Normal

Time: 10 Minutes

-------

With the Komodo software installed and a connection made to our community, you are prepared to begin learning about Komodo on a conceptual level.

These conceptual concepts must be grasped first, before attempting to manipulate blockchain assets and software. The concepts help to orient you in your development process. 

##### Platform Overview

The Platform Overview section provides the broadest conceptual understanding of the Komodo Platform.

[<b>Link to Platform Overview.</b>](../../../basic-docs/start-here/about-komodo-platform/about-komodo-platform.html)

##### Product Introductions

The Production Introductions section contains simplified introductions to Komodo software products and their architecture.

[<b>Link to Product Introductions</b>](../../../basic-docs/start-here/about-komodo-platform/product-introductions.html)

##### Doc Orientation

The Doc Orientation section gives the reader an understanding of the nature of this documentation website.
