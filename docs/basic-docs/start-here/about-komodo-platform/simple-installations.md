# Simple Installations

## Smart Chain Installation 

To install the Komodo daemon, `komodod`, and its necessary counterpart, `komodo-cli`, the simplest method is to download pre-compiled binaries.

Downloadable packages are available for Linux, MacOS, and Windows.

#### Link to Download Software

[Download and unzip the software files for your operating system..](https://github.com/KomodoPlatform/komodo/releases)

#### Installing the Simple Downloadable Files

Once unzipped, the executables do not require installation. Simply find `komodod` and `komodo-cli` in the directory where you unzipped the files.

You may also build `komodod` and `komodo-cli` from source. This is not required, but it is considered the best practice. Building from source enables you to receive the latest patches and security upgrades the moment they are pushed to the `komodod` source.

#### Using the official Docker image

A Docker image based on the Ubuntu OS that has the Komodo software built from multiple branches like `dev`,`beta`,`research` can be found at [https://hub.docker.com/r/komodoofficial/komodo](https://hub.docker.com/r/komodoofficial/komodo). An example of how the image can be used is available in this [github repository](https://github.com/tonymorony/komodo_docker_tests).

#### See the Smart Chains Documentation for Further Details

Please see the full [Smart Chains](../../../basic-docs/smart-chains/introduction-to-smart-chain-documentation.html) technical documentation for full software explanations.

You will find [a walkthrough on building from source here.](../../../basic-docs/smart-chains/smart-chain-setup/installing-from-source.html)
