# About Komodo

After years of innovation and development, Komodo has built a multi-chain architecture that overcomes all of the challenges facing other traditional smart-contract platforms.

## The Four Pillars of Blockchain Technology

Komodo's philosophy for decentralization relies on four pillars: security, scalability, interoperability, and adaptability.

With these four pillars in place, all types of users of Komodo software will find powerful, customizable solutions that will set your blockchain creations free. 

#### Security: Enjoy the Protection of the Bitcoin Hash Rate

(Need graphics here)

Secure your project with the power of the Bitcoin network via Komodo’s delayed proof of work security mechanism. Don’t waste time worrying about attackers.

- Approximately every half hour, a hash of the developers blockchain is notarized to Bitcoin
- All transactions included in the hash are considered to have achieved finality
- For the consensus mechanism, arbitarily choose between a mixture of Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake

#### Scalability: Have a Blockchain All To Yourself. Want More Than One? No Problem.

Developers and their users have a full Smart Chain all to themselves, and can combine any number of Smart Chains together into one cluster. 

- Developers and their users can securely own a full Smart Chain
- Each Smart Chain is completely autonomous
- If your project grows beyond the capacity of a single chain, simply add more
- Scale your maximum transaction-per-second throughput into the millions, if desired
- No gas fees. All transaction fees are paid in your Smart Chain’s coin

#### Interoperability: Link Your Smart Chain to Other Smart Chains. Even Atomic-Swap Trade with Non-Smart Chains.

Your project is interoperable with all others in the Komodo ecosystem, plus connected with over 99% of coins and tokens through Komodo’s industry-leading atomic-swap technology.

- Komodo’s Multi-Chain Syncing feature allows you to scale out linearly on demand
- Smart Chains can verify and update local state based on the activity of compatible Smart Chains
- Transfer assets and tokens between compatible Smart Chains
- Use Komodo's atomic-swap DEX software to trade your Smart Chain assets with Non-Smart assets.

#### Adaptability: Develop Your Smart Chain at Will.

Adapt your blockchain to create a purpose-built solution that fits your individual needs. Receive all new features developed by Komodo to ensure your project is future-proofed. 

- Twenty-four different launch parameters are available to customize the functionality of your Smart Chain
- Rely on the Fluidity framework to fully customize your Smart Chain with unique and arbitrary code within the consensus mechanism
- Share and adopt code in Komodo's open-source community
- Dispose of Smart Chains that become data-weight heavy, or transfer them to fresh Smart Chains for ease of use
- No need for a virtual machine (VM) nor a VM-based programming language

#### Together, Komodo's Security Service is Unlike Anything Else

With the Smart Chain at your command, your are prepared to lift your decentralized application (dApp) to levels never before seen in the blockchain industry.

#### Smart Chains Rely on the Next Step in Blockchain Evolution: The Fluidity Framework

Komodo's Fluidity framework allows developers to add arbitrary code into the consensus mechansim of their Smart Chain.

This blockchain evolution allows innovators to better meet the demands of our customers.

#### Comparing a Smart Chain to a Smart-Contract Platform

### Fluidity Feature Highlights

#### Programmable Daemon

Functionality is built into the blockchain daemon – as opposed to traditional smart-contract platforms, which abstract a smart contract on top of a virtual machine.

#### Modular Design

Smart Chains are composed of independent and autonomous modules that are decoupled from the underlying blockchain consensus mechanism.

#### Autonomous & Sovereign

Smart Chains are not child chains nor are they dependent on other blockchains.

#### Turing-Complete

The Fluidity framework supports C/C++, meaning that it allows for Turing-complete code. With Fluidity, any program or software can be coded to run on your blockchain.

#### No Gas Fees

There are no gas fees with Fluidity. Regardless of how many processes a Fluidity module requires, running an instance of the module will only need a single transaction fee, paid in your blockchain’s coin.

#### Fluidity Module Library

The Fluidity framework already hosts a library of plug-and-play modules. Each module can add special conditions that must be met in order for your Smart Chain’s network to reach consensus.

#### Create Your Own Modules

Experienced developers can write custom modules, creating the building blocks and RPC calls they need to build more advanced blockchain-based games, dApps, and software.

#### White Label Products

## Komodo's Atomic-Swap Powered DEX

Komodo provides open-source atomic-swap software for trading seamlessly between essentially any blockchain asset in existence.

#### Enjoy All the Benefits of the Old Centralized Exchange System, While Enjoying the Innovations of the New System

Everything that was possible in the old system is also possible in the new system.

High-speed trading is easy, the DEX API allows you to create trading bots and app, and you can even trade on your mobile phone. 

Our DEX software is not bound to Komodo-based blockchain assets, either. If a blockchain asset can trade on a centralized exchange, odds are you can atomic-swap it on our DEX software as well.

#### Skip the Centralized Middleman, and Trade Directly with Your Trading Partner

In an atomic swap, there is no need to lend your money to a third party for temporary holding. This reduces the cost of fees and prevents the users from coalescing their funds into a target for hackers.

#### Keep Your Private Keys Private, At All Times

Unlike a centralized exchange, users maintain ownership over their blockchain assets at all times, right up until the moment when their assets are atomically swapped.

#### Join the Crowd, or Start a New One

Users create their own liquidity pools for trading between assets. You can use a pool that is already established, or start your own pool.

#### No Off-Chain Settlements Required

The Komodo software uses atomic-swap technology, pioneered by Tier Nolan and our very own JL777, to ensure that a trade either happens, or it doesn't. If a trade stalls or fails halfway through the process, blockchain software ensures that these funds automatically reappear in the user's wallet.

#### Integrate Your Smart-Chain Asset with Our Software

Integration requires only a few simple steps, and once up and running, you are free to trade your new blockchain-based asset with whomever you decide. 

You are free to discover your own audience.
