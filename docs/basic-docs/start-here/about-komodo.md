# About Komodo

After years of innovation and development, Komodo has built a multi-chain architecture that overcomes all of the challenges facing other traditional smart-contract platforms.

## The Four Pillars of Blockchain Technology

Komodo's philosophy for decentralization relies on four pillars: security, scalability, interoperability, and adaptability.

With these four pillars in place, all types of users of Komodo software will find powerful, customizable solutions that will set your blockchain creations free. 

#### Enjoy the Protection of the Bitcoin Hash Rate

Secure your project with the power of the Bitcoin network via Komodo’s delayed proof of work security mechanism. Don’t waste time worrying about attackers.

- Approximately every half hour, a hash of the developers blockchain is notarized to Bitcoin
- All transactions included in the hash are considered to have achieved finality
- For the consensus mechanism, arbitarily choose between a mixture of Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake

#### Have a Blockchain All To Yourself. Want More Than One? No Problem.

Developers and their users have a full Smart Chain all to themselves, and can combine any number of Smart Chains together into one cluster. 

- Developers and their users can securely own a full Smart Chain
- Each Smart Chain is completely autonomous
- If your project grows beyond the capacity of a single chain, simply add more
- Scale your maximum transaction-per-second throughput into the millions, if desired
- No gas fees. All transaction fees are paid in your Smart Chain’s coin

#### Link Your Smart Chain to Other Smart Chains. Even Atomic-Swap Trade with Non-Smart Chains.

Your project is interoperable with all others in the Komodo ecosystem, plus connected with over 99% of coins and tokens through Komodo’s industry-leading atomic-swap technology.

- Komodo’s Multi-Chain Syncing feature allows you to scale out linearly on demand
- Smart Chains can verify and update local state based on the activity of compatible Smart Chains
- Transfer assets and tokens between compatible Smart Chains
- Use Komodo's atomic-swap DEX software to trade your Smart Chain assets with Non-Smart assets.

#### Adapt Your Smart Chain at Will.

Adapt your blockchain to create a purpose-built solution that fits your individual needs. Receive all new features developed by Komodo to ensure your project is future-proofed. 

- Twenty-four different launch parameters are available to customize the functionality of your Smart Chain
- Rely on the Fluidity framework to fully customize your Smart Chain with unique and arbitrary code within the consensus mechanism
- Dispose of Smart Chains that become data-weight heavy, or transfer them to fresh Smart Chains for ease of use
- No need for a virtual machine (VM) nor a VM-based programming language

#### Together, Komodo's Security Service is Unlike Anything Else

With the Smart Chain at their command, a developer is prepared to lift their decentralized application (dApp) to levels never before seen in the blockchain industry.

## The Fluidity Framework

Komodo provides a brand-new way to adopt blockchain technology: the Fluidity framework.

This open-source technology allows anyone to customize and launch their own autonomous, purpose-built Smart Chain.

#### An adaptable framework for end-to-end blockchain development

Using the Fluidity framework, you can build a customized, autonomous, and modular Smart Chain. After that, you can add custom consensus modules to design purpose-built, high-performing blockchain applications.
 
##### Fluidity Modules

- Choose from a library of powerful, built-in modules 
- All modules are plug-and-play
- Create unique consensus rules by coding your own custom modules
- Written in C/C++, Fluidity modules are Turing complete and secure

##### Fluidity API

- Open API
- Code games and dApps with RPC calls alone
- All software runs natively on your Smart Chain

### Fluidity Smart Chains are the optimal way to adopt blockchain technology

Fluidity Smart Chains are customizable, autonomous, purpose-built blockchains. They’re Turing complete and fully programmable, so they can natively support any game, app, or software.

Don’t change your business to fit a specific blockchain. Craft a specific blockchain to fit your business.

### Fluidity Modules are plugins that offer your Smart Chain endless possibilities.

#### Turing-Complete

The Fluidity framework supports C/C++, meaning that it allows for Turing-complete code. With Fluidity, any program or software can be coded to run on your blockchain.

#### No Gas Fees

There are no gas fees with Fluidity. Regardless of how many processes a Fluidity module requires, running an instance of the module will only need a single transaction fee, paid in your blockchain’s coin.

#### Fluidity Module Library

The Fluidity framework already hosts a library of plug-and-play modules. Each module can add special conditions that must be met in order for your Smart Chain’s network to reach consensus.

#### Create Your Own Modules

Experienced developers can write custom modules, creating the building blocks and RPC calls they need to build more advanced blockchain-based games, dApps, and software.

#### Komodo lowers the barrier to blockchain with an application layer

- Open API - Apps connect to your Smart Chain through Fluidity’s open API
- Easy To Develop - Ordinary developers can now utilize blockchain technology

#### White Label Products

Go-to-market faster with Komodo’s white-label applications

- Multi-Asset Wallet For Desktop & Mobi
- Atomic Swap Decentralized Exchange
- Decentralized Crowdfunding App
- Custom Block Explorers 
- SPV Electrum Server Integration
- Core Fluidity Modules

## Komodo DEX

Komodo provides open-source atomic-swap software for trading seamlessly between essentially any blockchain asset in existence.

### Keep Your Private Keys Private, At All Times

Unlike a centralized exchange, users maintain ownership over their blockchain assets at all times, right up until the moment when their assets are atomically swapped.

### Skip the Centralized Middleman, and Trade Directly with Your Trading Partner

In an atomic swap, there is no need to lend your money to a third party for temporary holding. This reduces the cost of fees, mitigates and removes market manipulation, and prevents the users from coalescing their funds into a target for hackers.

### Enjoy All the Benefits of the Old Centralized Exchange System, While Enjoying the Innovations of the New System

Everything that was possible in the old system is also possible in the new system. All we need are users.

- High-speed trading is easy
- Trade on your mobile phone
- Create trading bots
- Keep all your assets in one wallet
- Decide which assets you want to directly trade against which. No need to always trade through Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency medium.

### Use Either an Existing Network, or Set Up Your Own

Users create their own liquidity pools for trading between assets. 

Use a pool that is already established, or start your own pool.

### Trades Either Occur, or They Do Not. No Off-Chain Settlements Required

The Komodo software uses atomic-swap technology, pioneered by Tier Nolan and our very own JL777, to ensure that a trade either happens, or it doesn't. If a trade stalls or fails halfway through the process, blockchain software ensures that these funds automatically reappear in their wallet.

### Integrate Your Smart Chain Asset with Our Software

Integration requires only a few simple steps, and once up and running, you are free to trade your new blockchain-based asset with whomever you decide. Bring your own networks. Bring your own users.

## A Timeline of Komodo History

For five years, Komodo team members have been technology pioneers and industry influencers.

— Year 2014 – James ‘ jl777’ Lee builds a proxy token gateway on the NXT platform that lets users trade NXT to BTC and other popular cryptocurrencies without trusted third parties. 

— Year 2015 – The NXT platform makes a series of major codebase upgrades that are not backward compatible. As a result, all of jl777’s backend code is no longer working.

— February 2016 – Understanding the flaws of a single-chain platform architecture, jl777 issues his Blockchain Declaration of Independence and founds the Komodo Platform.

::: tip JL777's Declaration of Independence
We the asset holders hereby declare our independence from any single blockchain. An open and jointly developed specification on cross chain atomic asset transfers will be developed. Any current or future blockchain is invited to join.
