# About Komodo

After years of innovation and development, Komodo has built a multi-chain architecture that overcomes all of the challenges facing other traditional smart-contract platforms.

From small-businesses to full-scale enterprises, users of Komodo software will find powerful, customizable solutions that will set your blockchain creations free. 

#### Enjoy the Protection of the Bitcoin Hash Rate

Secure your project with the power of the Bitcoin network via Komodo’s delayed proof of work security mechanism. Don’t waste time worrying about attackers.

- About every half hour, a hash of the developers blockchain is notarized to Bitcoin
- All transactions included in the hash are considered to have achieved finality
- For the consensus mechanism, arbitarily choose between a mixture of Proof-of-Work and Proof-of-Stake

#### Have a Blockchain All To Yourself. Want More Than One? No Problem.

Developers and their users have a full Smart Chain all to themselves, and can combine any number of Smart Chains together into one cluster. 

- Developers and their users can securely own a full blockchain
- Each Smart Chain is completely autonomous
- If your project grows beyond the capacity of a single chain, simply add more. 
- Scale your maximum transaction-per-second throughput into the millions, if desired
- Transaction fees are always paid in each Smart Chain’s coin
- No gas fees. All transaction fees are paid in your Smart Chain’s coin

#### Link Your Smart Chain to Other Smart Chains. Even Atomic-Swap Trade with Non-Smart Chains.

Your project is interoperable with all others in the Komodo ecosystem, plus connected with over 99% of coins and tokens through Komodo’s industry-leading atomic-swap technology.

- Komodo’s Multi-Chain Syncing feature allows you to scale out linearly on demand. 
- Smart Chains can verify and update local state based on the activity of compatible Smart Chains
- Transfer assets and tokens between compatible Smart Chains
- Use Komodo's atomic-swap DEX software to trade your Smart Chain assets with Non-Smart assets.

#### Adapt Your Smart Chain at Will.

Adapt your blockchain to create a purpose-built solution that fits your individual needs. Receive all new features developed by Komodo to ensure your project is future-proofed. 

- Twenty-four different launch parameters are available to customize the functionality of your Smart Chain
- Rely on the Fluidity framework to fully customize your Smart Chain with unique and arbitrary code within the consensus mechanism
- Dispose of Smart Chains that become data-weight heavy, or transfer them to fresh Smart Chains for ease of use
- No need for a virtual machine (VM) nor a VM-based programming language

#### Together, Komodo's Security Service is Unlike Anything Else

With the Smart Chain at their command, a developer is prepared to lift their decentralized application (dApp) to levels never before seen in the blockchain industry.

## The Fluidity Framework

Komodo provides a brand-new way to adopt blockchain technology: the Fluidity framework.

This open-source technology allows anyone to customize and launch their own autonomous, purpose-built Smart Chain with the new Fluidity framework.

#### An adaptable framework for end-to-end blockchain development

Using the Fluidity framework, you can build a customized, autonomous, and modular Smart Chain. After that, you can add custom consensus modules to design purpose-built, high-performing blockchain applications.
 
##### Fluidity Modules

- Choose from a library of powerful, built-in modules 
- All modules are plug-and-play
- Create unique consensus rules by coding your own custom modules
- Written in C/C++, Fluidity modules are Turing complete and secure

##### Fluidity API

- Open API
- Code games and dApps with RPC calls alone
- All software runs natively on your Smart Chain

## Fluidity Smart Chains are the optimal way to adopt blockchain technology.

Fluidity Smart Chains are customizable, autonomous, purpose-built blockchains. They’re Turing complete and fully programmable, so they can natively support any game, app, or software.

##### Customizable

Choose settings from twenty-four different parameters to fully customize your Smart Chain.

##### Autonomous

Your Smart Chain has its own decentralized network, consensus rules, and currency.

##### Modular

Use plug-and-play Fluidity modules and an open API to build any blockchain solutions you need

##### Purpose-Built

Don’t change your business to fit a specific blockchain. Craft a specific blockchain to fit your business.

## Fluidity Modules are plugins that offer your Smart Chain endless possibilities.

##### Turing-Complete

The Fluidity framework supports C/C++, meaning that it allows for Turing-complete code. With Fluidity, any program or software can be coded to run on your blockchain.

##### No Gas Fees

There are no gas fees with Fluidity. Regardless of how many processes a Fluidity module requires, it will only need a single transaction fee, paid in your blockchain’s coin, to run.

##### Fluidity Module Library

The Fluidity framework already hosts a library of plug-and-play modules. Each module can add special conditions that must be met in order for your Smart Chain’s network to reach consensus.

##### Create Your Own Modules

Experienced developers can write custom modules, creating the building blocks and RPC calls they need to build more advanced blockchain-based games, dApps, and software.

## Komodo lowers the barrier to blockchain with an application layer.

#### Open API

Apps connect to your Smart Chain through Fluidity’s open API

#### Easy To Develop

Ordinary developers can now utilize blockchain technology

#### White Label Products

Go-To-Market faster with Komodo’s white label applications

#### Multi-Asset Wallet For Desktop & Mobile

#### Atomic Swap Decentralized Exchange

#### Decentralized Crowdfunding App

#### Custom Block Explorers 

#### SPV Electrum Server Integration

#### Core Fluidity Modules

(Timeline Plugin Content)

— Year 2014 – James ‘ jl777’ Lee builds a proxy token gateway on the NXT platform that lets users trade NXT to BTC and other popular cryptocurrencies without trusted third parties. 

— Year 2015 – The NXT platform makes a series of major codebase upgrades that are not backward compatible. As a result, all of jl777’s backend code is no longer working.

— February 2016 – Understanding the flaws of a single-chain platform architecture, jl777 issues his Blockchain Declaration of Independence and founds the Komodo Platform.

— October 2016 – The Komodo ICO begins, raising funds to make Komodo’s remarkable multi-chain vision a reality. Komodo’s ICO lasts 35 days and brings in a total of 2,639 BTC.

— January 2017 – The Komodo mainnet is launched, delivering on what was promised: Bitcoin-level security, zero-knowledge privacy, and independent blockchain creation.

— March 2017 – Komodo releases the first iteration of its atomic swap powered DEX, allowing rudimentary peer-to-peer swaps among BTC-protocol coins from a CLI.

— October 2017 – The Komodo team integrates Electrum SPV server support for atomic swaps, making it possible to do atomic swaps without downloading full blockchains.

— February 2018 – Komodo bridges the gap between BTC-based coins and ERC-20 tokens, allowing direct atomic swaps between 95% of all coins and tokens.

— July 2018 – Komodo announces new features: Blockchain Security Service, Multi-Chain Syncing, and Cross-Chain Interoperability Linking.

— August 2018 – Komodo implements the Custom Consensus framework, allowing Turing-complete code to modify a blockchain’s consensus rules on a case-by-case basis. 

— November 2018 — Komodo releases Agama wallet on mobile for both Android and iOS and integrates ETH and over 100 ERC-20 tokens to the desktop version of Agama.
