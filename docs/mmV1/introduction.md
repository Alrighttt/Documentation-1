Komodo’s decentralized exchange, mmV1, allows people to trade cryptocurrency coins without a counterparty risk. The protocol is open-source and trading is
available for any coin that any developers choose to connect to mmV1. The parent
project, Komodo, freely provides mmV1 technology through open-source philosophy. Our service fully realizes decentralized order matching, trade clearing, and
settlement. The order-matching aspect uses a low-level pubkey-to-pubkey messaging
protocol, and the final settlement is executed through an atomic cross-chain protocol.
Like any exchange, our decentralized alternative requires liquidity, and we provide
methods and incentives therein.

The current, most practical method for cryptocurrency exchange requires the use of
centralized exchange services. Such centralized solutions require vouchers to perform
the exchange. Among many dangers present in this system, end-users are under
the constant risk of their assets being stolen either by an inside theft or an outside
hack. Furthermore, the operators of centralized exchanges an exhibit bias in how
they facilitate trading among their users. They can also create fake levels of volume
on their exchange. To eliminate such dangers and limitations requires the creation of
a decentralized-exchange alternative.

Among all the centralized exchanges, trading tends to coalesce around a few of the
most popular. There is a reason for this behavior. Trading via vouchers is fast; a central
exchange can swap internal vouchers instantaneously, whereas trading actual cryptocurrencies through human-to-human coordination requires communication from
both parties. It requires waiting for blockchain miners to calculate transaction confirmations.

The speed advantage of a centralized exchange, therefore, creates a compounding
effect on the centralization of traders. The faster processing time of vouchers attracts
more people: the increased presence of traders creates higher liquidity: with more
liquidity, the exchange can feature better prices: the higher quality of prices in turn
attracts a larger community, and the cycle repeats. This is a classic Network Effect,
and it is the reason that a few centralized exchanges dominate with high-volume trading, while smaller exchanges—both centralized and decentralized—suffer from a
lack of liquidity.
