#### Options for Things We Can Create

##### Overall Structure of Content

###### Option 1: Entirely Written
 - We currently have everything in a scattered written format.

 We can bring everything together into one written curriculum.

 This would involve my rewriting the content and receiving feedback and support from team members, such as Dimxy and Mylo.

###### Option 2: Primarily Written, with some Video and Programmed Interactivity

In addition to coallescing all written material into a targeted tutorial series, as described in Option 1, we can also add a few videos into the presentation.

These videos would appear occasionally throughout the writing, and would provide some simple graphics and video demonstration of the most visually important concepts and processes.

###### Option 3: Full video, with accompanying written transcript

Alterantively, we can create a Udemy-like course that has a constant video presentation for the entire discussion of the Komodo software suite.

This would be suitable for display on an external site, such as Udemy, Lynda, or others.

#### Nature of Interactivity

- Quizzes
  - Scattered throughout the material,
- A support community
  - Monitored Discord channel for users going through the course
- Optional availability of access to a Komodo Developer, to assist in answering questions
  - Would come at an additional cost to the user
- A test chain (likely one that already exists) that allows users to record their completion of the course and questions on the blockchain
  - Users submit answers online. Our servers process questions and send a transaction as proof that records data of user's passing test
  - If we then draw this into the Hivebright profile, it would serve as an in-practice example of Komodo and blockchain power in action
- A possible test at the end with a Komodo team member, wherein we do a video interview to determine their qualifications
  - This may be something for third-party service providers

## Profile Badges and Certifications

### Completion Certificates

Completion Certificates are Elligible for 24 months, and then must be renewed by retaking the quizzes.

This allows a badge holder to expect a reasonable amount of time to capitalize on their completion of the course, and at the same time, Komodo can expect to renew and adjust community expectations on a regular time interval.

We can update the completion certificates in real time, and not worry about users who took it previously and may have missed a topic. We can assume that within the next 24 months, if they are an active ecosystem contributor, they will recomplete the course and take any new material into account.

There is no cost to a completion certificate. It is merely a matter of convenience for the community, and this provides a measurement that can be used for observation.

##### Level 1: Business Professional - Completion Certificate

Covers conceptual understandings only.

Online quizzes and interactivity only, using all automation. No in-person interactivity required.

##### Level 2: Community Contributor - Certificate and Recognition

A recognized community contributor has both surpassed the above quiz, and is involved with community support in some fashion.

For example, this can be someone who has proven that they understand Komodo, and are actively involved in supporting the community on an online and social level.

No additional quizzes are required. This is simply given out to anyone who has passed Level 1 and receives authorization from a Komodo Team Member.

This could also be given as a side badge, or a badge-within-a-badge.

For example, receiving a Level 1 badge puts a green circle on the lower corner of your profile picture.

Getting the Level 2 authorization puts a white star symbol within the green badge.

##### Level 3: Komodo Developer Track - Completion Certificate

Covers all beginner topics and tutorials, up to Step 14 of the (current) outline.

Online quizzes and interactivity only, using automation. No in-person interactivity required.

Encourages that the developer also list an additional skill set on their profile. This can be a certification in a programming language, or a full university-level degree.

Also encourages user to link to a Github profile that demonstrates their work capabilities.

##### Level 4: Advanced Komodo Developer Track - Completion Certificate

Includes everything up to this point, and then additional quizzes and automated interactivity to finish the Learning Path Outline.

Encourages the display of additional skill sets, degrees, and a Github (or other) portfolio.

### Advanced Community Contributor

##### Level 5: Source Code Contributor - Authorized Recognition

This level of community recognition is for community members who pass all the above tests, and successfully contribute to the source code.

Once the user receives this badge, they get an additional section that opens up on their profile that allows them to manage their unique contribution to the source code.

That way, they can state what they contributed and worry about managing their personal presentation.

### Notary Node

This is also a side badge, and it is available to anywho who reaches Level 3 or above.

No person should be allowed to run for a notary node position until they have passed this test.

### Third-party Service Provider Authorization and Certification

This is for groups of individuals (who are also on Hivebright community)

##### Level 6: Authorized Third-party Service Provider

A third-party service provider must have at least two members.

Both members must reach Level 1 on their own, and at least one member must reach Level 4.

Once they have reached these levels of contribution, the group is required to submit an application.

As a part of the application process, they must do a video interview with a qualified Komodo team member. During the interview, the Komodo team member will ask them basic conceptual questions that they must answer without referencing the documentation.

They must also submit one simple portfolio piece that demonstrate their ability to utilize the Komodo API.

A third-party service provider must have a registered business that is a taxable organization in a recognized area of the world.

 Throughout our documentation, and across the website, service providers are ranked according to the points with which they represent.

 So, for each Level 1 badge holder within their organization, they receive one point.

 In addition, if they provide verified proof that they have certain recognized industry certifications and degrees, we can give them additional points.

 So, an accredited univeristy, or a highly reputable certification program: these are useful and we can add these into the mix.

The Komodo team adds these additional points at our own discretion. Steve can be the gatekeeper here.

These group profile pages are held in a separate portion of the Hivebright community, and are classified separately -- similar to the manner in which Facebook seperates users from Facebook Pages (which can be company-oriented).
