# A Komodo-based Stablecoin

- Introduction:
	- The Komodo team presents a stablecoin, allowing ecosystem users to create products that are bought, sold, and traded using familiar and stable market prices.
- The problems of the cryptocurrency market
	- One of the largest challenges when building a cryptocurrency-backed product is that users can be turned off by economic volatility
- A common solution is to offer a stablecoin
	- CEX's offer these to help users have some place to store money where there is a less volatile expectation of future value
- Komodo now offers stablecoin technology
	- This allows Komodo ecosystem users to buy, sell, and trade in a more stable environment
- How it works
	- Users lock a familiar cryptocurrency as a collateral loan to the Pegs Smart Chain
 		- Can include Bitcoin/Komodo, anything from the Bitcoin protocol
	- The Pegs Smart Chain issues them coins that mimic the value of a foreign asset
	- Users can buy/sell/trade these coins 
	- As prices change, there are methods available to the users of the ecosystem to either manager their own collateral loan accounts and keep them current
	- Or, other users can purchase the excess debt of other users
	- When the debt of a user's account becomes high, other users can purchase the user's debt at a profit
	- At any time, a user can trade the stablecoins in for the collateralize assets
	- These asset can then be sent back to other exchanges, such as CEXs
- This allows Komodo users to create and self-manage stable economic environments
